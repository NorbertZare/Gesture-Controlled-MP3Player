Gesture Controlled MP3Player

in this project I use gesture sensor to read and interpret hand movements as commands to control an MP3 Player.
Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. 
Users can use simple gestures to control or interact with devices without physically touching them.
gesture controlled devices are so helpful for times like pandemic because they don't need physical touching. so companies should focus more on this technology and make more gesture controlled devices.

In this project I used a PAJ7620U2 Gesture Sensor.
PAJ7620U2 Gesture Sensor, gesture recognition function with general I2C interface into a single chip. It can recognize 9 gestures including move up, move down, move left, move right, etc. with a simple swipe of your hand.
(this sensor works with 3.3V)

in most of the mp3 players pressing button sets the pin to LOW, so I connected MP3 Player buttons to Arduino to control it.
you can control any other device instead of MP3 Player.
